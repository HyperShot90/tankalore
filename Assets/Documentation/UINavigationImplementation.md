# UI Navigation & Upgrade Flow Implementation Summary

## Step 13: Completed Implementation

### ✅ MainMenu Navigation
**File**: `Assets/Scripts/UI/MainMenuManager.cs`
- **Play Button**: Loads "Game" scene using `SceneManager.LoadScene("Game")`
- **Upgrades Button**: Loads "UpgradeShop" scene using `SceneManager.LoadScene("UpgradeShop")`
- **Quit Button**: Exits application (handles both editor and build environments)
- **Additional Features**: Settings panel, currency display, volume controls

### ✅ In-Game HUD
**File**: `Assets/Scripts/UI/UIManager.cs` (Already Implemented)
- **Health Bar**: Shows current HP vs max HP using slider
- **XP Bar**: Shows current XP progress toward next level
- **Level Display**: Shows current player level
- **Currency Display**: Shows session currency earned
- **Timer Display**: Shows survival time or countdown
- **Wave Display**: Shows current enemy wave number

### ✅ Upgrade System Integration
**File**: `Assets/Scripts/Systems/Upgrades/UpgradeManager.cs` (Already Implemented)

#### UpgradeManager ↔ XPSystem Integration:
1. **Event Subscription**: UpgradeManager subscribes to `XPSystem.OnLevelUp` event
2. **Level Up Handler**: `HandleLevelUp(int newLevel)` method called on level up
3. **Time Pause**: `Time.timeScale = 0f` pauses game during upgrade selection
4. **Upgrade Choices**: Generates 3 random upgrade options based on player level and rarity
5. **Choice Display**: Triggers `OnUpgradeChoicesReady` event to show UI

#### Upgrade Selection Flow:
1. **UI Display**: `UIManager.ShowUpgradeChoices()` activates upgrade panel with 3 buttons
2. **Button Setup**: Each `UpgradeButton` displays upgrade info (name, description, icon, rarity colors)
3. **Player Selection**: Clicking button triggers `OnUpgradeSelected` event
4. **Apply Upgrade**: `UpgradeManager.ApplyUpgrade()` modifies player stats via `TankStats`
5. **Resume Game**: `Time.timeScale = 1f` resumes gameplay after selection

### ✅ UpgradeShop Scene
**File**: `Assets/Scripts/UI/UpgradeShopManager.cs`
- **Navigation**: Back to MainMenu and direct Play button
- **Currency Display**: Shows total persistent currency
- **Category System**: Health, Damage, Speed, Special upgrade categories
- **Permanent Upgrades**: Persistent upgrades using currency
- **Progress Reset**: Option to reset all permanent upgrades

**File**: `Assets/Scripts/UI/PermanentUpgradeButton.cs`
- **Currency Integration**: Uses `CurrencyManager.SpendCurrency()`
- **Progressive Costs**: Base cost × multiplier^level formula
- **Visual Feedback**: Colors indicate affordability (green/red/yellow)
- **Save System**: Persistent upgrade levels via PlayerPrefs
- **Level Display**: Current level / max level with effect values

### ✅ Event System Architecture
```
XPSystem.OnLevelUp → UpgradeManager.HandleLevelUp()
                  ↓
UpgradeManager.OnUpgradeChoicesReady → UIManager.ShowUpgradeChoices()
                  ↓
UpgradeButton.OnUpgradeSelected → UpgradeManager.ApplyUpgrade()
                  ↓
Player Stats Modified → Game Resumes (Time.timeScale = 1f)
```

### ✅ Scene Flow Architecture
```
MainMenu Scene
├── Play Button → Game Scene
├── Upgrades Button → UpgradeShop Scene
└── Quit Button → Exit Application

Game Scene
├── In-Game HUD (HP, XP, Level, Currency, Timer)
├── Upgrade Flow (Pause → Choose → Apply → Resume)
└── Game Over → Return to MainMenu

UpgradeShop Scene
├── Permanent Upgrades (Currency-based)
├── Category Navigation
├── Back to MainMenu Button
└── Direct Play Button → Game Scene
```

### 🎯 Key Features Implemented

1. **Complete Navigation Flow**: All three scenes interconnected with proper scene loading
2. **Pause-and-Choose Upgrade System**: Time pauses during upgrade selection
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling between systems via events
4. **Visual Polish**: Rarity colors, hover effects, scaling animations
5. **Persistent Progress**: Currency and permanent upgrades saved across sessions
6. **Robust UI Updates**: Real-time updates for currency, health, XP, etc.
7. **Error Handling**: Null checks and fallbacks throughout the codebase
