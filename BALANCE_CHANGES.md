# Tankalore - Balance and Tuning Changes (Step 15)

## Overview
This document summarizes all balance and tuning changes made during Step 15: Play-Mode Testing & Polish.

## Physics & Movement Tuning

### PlayerController Physics
- **Drag Value**: Increased from `5f` to `8f`
  - **Reason**: Better movement control, reduces sliding, more responsive feel
  - **Impact**: Player tank stops more quickly when input is released

## Enemy Spawn System Tuning

### EnemySpawner Balance Changes
- **Base Enemies Per Wave**: Reduced from `5` to `4`
  - **Reason**: Better pacing for early game, less overwhelming start
- **Wave Scaling**: Reduced from `1.2f` to `1.15f`
  - **Reason**: More gradual difficulty increase, prevents exponential difficulty spikes
- **Time Between Waves**: Reduced from `10f` to `8f` seconds
  - **Reason**: Faster pacing, less downtime between action sequences
- **Time Between Spawns**: Reduced from `1f` to `0.8f` seconds
  - **Reason**: Slightly faster enemy spawning within waves

## XP System Tuning

### XP Progression Balance
- **Base XP Required**: Reduced from `100` to `80`
  - **Reason**: Faster early progression, more frequent upgrades
- **XP Scaling**: Reduced from `1.2f` to `1.15f`
  - **Reason**: More consistent level-up intervals throughout game

## Player Tank Stats (DefaultPlayerTank.asset)

### Combat Stats Improvements
- **Max Health**: Increased from `100` to `120`
  - **Reason**: Better survivability for balanced gameplay
- **Armor**: Increased from `5` to `8`
  - **Reason**: Better damage mitigation against enemy attacks
- **Firepower**: Increased from `25` to `30`
  - **Reason**: More satisfying combat, faster enemy elimination
- **Movement Speed**: Increased from `5` to `6`
  - **Reason**: More responsive movement and better kiting ability
- **Rotation Speed**: Increased from `180` to `200`
  - **Reason**: Better aiming responsiveness
- **Fire Rate**: Increased from `1` to `1.2`
  - **Reason**: More engaging combat rhythm
- **Bullet Speed**: Increased from `10` to `12`
  - **Reason**: Better projectile travel time, more satisfying shooting
- **Range**: Increased from `10` to `12`
  - **Reason**: Better engagement distances

## Enemy Stats Rebalancing

### Basic Enemy (BasicEnemy.asset)
- **Max Health**: Reduced from `50` to `45`
- **Damage**: Increased from `15` to `18`
- **Movement Speed**: Increased from `3` to `3.5`
- **Detection Range**: Increased from `8` to `9`
- **Attack Range**: Increased from `6` to `7`
- **Fire Rate**: Increased from `0.5` to `0.6`
- **Bullet Speed**: Increased from `8` to `9`

**Rationale**: Slightly more aggressive but less tanky, creating faster-paced encounters.

### Fast Enemy (FastEnemy.asset)
- **Max Health**: Increased from `30` to `35`
- **Damage**: Increased from `12` to `14`
- **Movement Speed**: Increased from `6` to `7`
- **Detection Range**: Increased from `10` to `11`
- **Attack Range**: Increased from `5` to `6`
- **Fire Rate**: Increased from `0.8` to `1.0`
- **Bullet Speed**: Increased from `12` to `14`

**Rationale**: Enhanced the "fast" archetype while maintaining threat level.

### Heavy Enemy (HeavyEnemy.asset)
- **Max Health**: Reduced from `100` to `90`
- **Damage**: Increased from `30` to `35`
- **Movement Speed**: Increased from `1.5` to `2.0`
- **Detection Range**: Increased from `6` to `7`
- **Attack Range**: Increased from `8` to `9`
- **Fire Rate**: Increased from `0.3` to `0.4`
- **Bullet Speed**: Increased from `6` to `7`

**Rationale**: Less health but more damage and slightly improved mobility to maintain threat.

## Testing Implementation

### PlayModeValidator Script
- Added automated testing system to validate core gameplay functions
- Tests included:
  - Initial state validation
  - Player movement system
  - Enemy spawning mechanics
  - XP system functionality
  - Session timer accuracy
  - Upgrade system integration

## Expected Gameplay Impact

### Player Experience
- **Movement**: More responsive and controlled tank handling
- **Combat**: More satisfying damage output and survivability
- **Progression**: Faster early-game progression with consistent pacing
- **Challenge**: Better balanced enemy encounters with varied threats

### Game Flow
- **Pacing**: Reduced downtime between waves, faster progression
- **Difficulty**: More gradual increase preventing sudden difficulty spikes
- **Engagement**: More frequent upgrade opportunities keeping players engaged

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Play Testing**:
   - Verify movement feels responsive and controlled
   - Confirm enemy waves spawn at appropriate intervals
   - Check upgrade system triggers correctly on level-up
   - Validate session timer countdown and game over transitions

2. **Balance Verification**:
   - Monitor average session duration
   - Track player survival rates across different skill levels
   - Observe upgrade selection patterns
   - Evaluate enemy threat balance

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Ensure stable framerate during peak enemy counts
   - Verify memory usage remains stable over long sessions
   - Test pause/resume functionality

## Next Steps
- Deploy build with tuned values
- Collect playtesting feedback
- Monitor gameplay metrics
- Iterate on balance based on player data
